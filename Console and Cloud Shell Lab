Objectives
In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

        Get access to Google Cloud.

        Create a Cloud Storage bucket using the Cloud Console.

        Create a Cloud Storage bucket using Cloud Shell.

        Become familiar with Cloud Shell features.
        
 
 1. Create a bucket using the Cloud Console
    
    -Set location where the bucket will be created
   
        export LOCATION=US
    
    -Creat bucket in the specified location
        gsutil mb -l $LOCATION gs://kenya-gucha
      
 2. Create a bucket using Cloud Shell
      gsutil mb gs://kenya-gucha2
    
    -To list the buckets created 
    
        gsutil ls
 -Upload text file from your local computer to cloud storage
        
        
   list the objects uploaded to cloud shell to confirm the file was uploaded successfully
          ls
        
 -Copy the file into one of the buckets you created earlier in the lab.
      gsutil cp web.txt gs://kenya-gucha  
      
 3. Create a persistent state in Cloud Shell
      
      -list available regions, execute the following command
          gcloud compute regions list
          
i) -Create and verify an environment variable
 
    -Create an environment variable and replace [YOUR_REGION] with the region you selected in the previous step:
          INFRACLASS_REGION=us-central1
          
     -Verify it with echo:
          echo $INFRACLASS_REGION
          
 ii)-Append the environment variable to a file
       
       -Create a subdirectory for materials used in this class:
            mkdir infraclass
       -Create a file called config in the infraclass directory:
            touch infraclass/config
            
       -Append the value of your Region environment variable to the config file:
            echo INFRACLASS_REGION=$INFRACLASS_REGION >> ~/infraclass/config
            
       -Create a second environment variable for your Project ID, replacing [YOUR_PROJECT_ID] with your Project ID
            INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID=example-kenya-gucha-1
            
       -Append the value of your Project ID environment variable to the config file:
              echo INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID=$INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID >> ~/infraclass/config
              
       -Use the source command to set the environment variables, and use the echo command to verify that the project variable was set:
              source infraclass/config
              echo $INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID
              
      -Close and re-open Cloud Shell. Then issue the echo command again:
          echo $INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID
          
          -Results: There will be no output because the environment variable no longer exists.
          
          
  iii)-Modify the bash profile and create persistence
  
           -Edit the shell profile with the following command:
                nano .profile
                
            -Add the following line to the end of the file:
                source infraclass/config
                
                     -Press Ctrl+O, ENTER to save the file, and then press Ctrl+X to exit nano.
            
            -Close and then re-open Cloud Shell to cycle the VM.        
            -Use the echo command to verify that the variable is still set:
                  echo $INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID
                  
                      -Result:You should now see the expected value that you set in the config file.
